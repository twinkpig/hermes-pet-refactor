# Hermes Pets

Hermes Pets is a local desktop companion for Hermes-style daily work: a small animated overlay that reacts to commands, messages, briefs, and ambient status events while staying fully controllable from the terminal.

It exists to make long local coding sessions feel more legible and alive. The pet gives visible feedback when work starts, finishes, fails, needs attention, or goes quiet, without requiring a hosted service or remote account.

The repo combines a Python CLI, local state under `~/.hermes_pet`, and a
floating Electron overlay for WSL/Windows. The current Windows overlay exposes
the live WebSocket endpoint itself; older `bridge` names still appear in Python
modules and compatibility diagnostics. The current tool is focused on practical
operator use:

- Launch one floating pet overlay from WSL/Windows.
- Emit lightweight activity events to the overlay.
- Wrap commands so successes, failures, duration, and retry information are recorded.
- Send message notifications from external channels.
- Control quiet/mute preferences for bubbles.
- Generate a short local brief from recent jobs and events.
- Open a localhost-only, token-protected dashboard for state, custom pets, prefs, voice preview, and achievements.
- Diagnose overlay endpoint, state, prefs, and job-history health.

Pet state and local history live under `~/.hermes_pet` by default. Set `HERMES_PET_HOME` when you intentionally want an isolated state directory. Back up the directory itself when you need a restorable copy; `hermes-pet state export` is a redacted diagnostic snapshot, not a backup format.

Hermes Pets is now on the `1.0.0` formal release line. The active operator path
remains a git checkout plus direct module execution.

## Quickstart

Clone the repo, run from the checkout, then launch the overlay:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twinkpig/hermes-pet-refactor.git
cd hermes-pet-refactor
export PYTHONPATH=src

python3 -m hermes_pet.cli launch --replace
python3 -m hermes_pet.cli emit bubble "Hello from Hermes Pets"
python3 -m hermes_pet.cli doctor
python3 -m hermes_pet.cli dashboard --no-open
```

If you want the short command locally, point it at this checkout instead of
creating a second install location:

```bash
alias hermes-pet='PYTHONPATH=/path/to/hermes-pet/src python3 -m hermes_pet.cli'
```

On WSL/Windows, run the CLI from WSL. On macOS, run it from the same user
session as Hermes TUI. `hermes-pet launch` syncs the managed Hermes plugin at
`~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-pet` on every platform, then opens the Electron
overlay. CLI and Hermes TUI lifecycle events both send to the overlay endpoint
on port `17473`.

## Platform Support

WSL2 on Windows 10/11 with Windows interop is the supported platform for the
full CLI, direct overlay endpoint, and floating Electron overlay experience.
macOS has the same Hermes plugin event path with a native Electron overlay and
local bridge. Native Linux and native Windows remain investigation targets.

See `docs/platform-support.md` for the supported platform matrix, CLI-only
boundaries, and known blockers.

Packaging and installer tradeoffs are tracked in
`docs/packaging-decision-notes.md`.

## Checkout Runtime And CLI

The maintained operator path is a git checkout plus direct module execution:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:twinkpig/hermes-pet-refactor.git
cd hermes-pet-refactor
export PYTHONPATH=src
python3 -m hermes_pet.cli status
```

For convenience, create a shell alias that points at this checkout:

```bash
alias hermes-pet='PYTHONPATH=/path/to/hermes-pet/src python3 -m hermes_pet.cli'
```

This project does not maintain a separate pip/PyPI deployment path for current
operator use. The checkout is the single source of truth for Python code,
Electron overlay assets, custom pet assets, and Hermes plugin templates.

The checkout runtime exposes:

```bash
python3 -m hermes_pet.cli
```

Running the CLI with no subcommand hatches a pet if one does not exist, or prints the current pet status.

Main commands:

```bash
hermes-pet launch
hermes-pet launch --replace
hermes-pet overlay-status
hermes-pet emit bubble "Starting work"
hermes-pet wrap --name "Tests" -- pytest
hermes-pet jobs --last
hermes-pet brief --since 24h
hermes-pet quiet
hermes-pet mute 30m
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet doctor --strict
```

Basic pet commands are also available:

```bash
hermes-pet status
hermes-pet hatch
hermes-pet rename "Hermes"
hermes-pet feed
hermes-pet pet
hermes-pet play
hermes-pet species
```

## Updating Hermes Pets

Use the guarded update command when you want Hermes Pets to inspect or update
itself without asking you to remember the git, Python packaging, and Electron
overlay steps by hand:

```bash
hermes-pet update --check
hermes-pet update --dry-run
hermes-pet update
hermes-pet update --yes
hermes-pet update --no-install
hermes-pet update --verbose
```

`hermes-pet update --check` gathers diagnostics, fetches git metadata for git
checkout installs, and reports whether the local branch is current, behind,
ahead, diverged, blocked by local changes, or missing an upstream. It does not
pull or install dependencies. A cleanly completed check exits successfully; read
the `Check result` and git status lines to distinguish current, update
available, and blocked states.

`hermes-pet update --dry-run` prints the planned fetch, comparison,
fast-forward-only update, dependency refresh, and validation steps without
mutating files. A normal `hermes-pet update` only updates git checkout installs
that have a clean working tree and a configured upstream branch. If an update is
available, interactive shells ask for confirmation; non-interactive shells must
pass `--yes` or `-y`.

Dirty working trees are blocked. The command will not merge, rebase, hard reset,
or auto-stash. Unknown install modes get diagnostics and manual guidance instead
of risky changes. Git checkout installs get the safest automatic path: fetch,
compare, fast-forward only, refresh dependencies when appropriate, then run
lightweight validation.

Dependency refreshes use the current Python executable and the overlay package
manager selected by lockfile: `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `yarn.lock`,
`package-lock.json`, then `npm install` when no lockfile is present.
`--no-install` skips both Python and Electron overlay dependency refresh and
prints the commands you can run manually.

`--verbose` adds extra install diagnostics, including recorded package source
metadata when Python packaging made it available. It still does not inspect or
write pet state.

Install diagnostics identify the Python executable, Python environment, package
location, editable status, recorded package source when available, git checkout
state, overlay dependency state, package manager availability, and Python
packaging files. Automatic git updates are only enabled when the running package
resolves to the repo source package, not merely because a virtual environment
lives somewhere inside a git checkout.

The update command never modifies `~/.hermes_pet`. It does not migrate, reset,
rewrite, delete, or back up pet state. If you need a backup, copy the real
`~/.hermes_pet` directory.

## Local Dashboard and Achievements

The local dashboard is the current operator console:

```bash
hermes-pet dashboard
hermes-pet dashboard --no-open
hermes-pet dashboard --host 127.0.0.1 --port 17474
```

The dashboard binds to localhost only and prints a per-process token URL. Keep
that URL private. Requests without the token are rejected, including API calls.
The token is also stored in a local dashboard cookie so browser navigation can
continue to call the protected API without exposing an unauthenticated control
surface. This is not a hosted or remote dashboard.

The dashboard is the working console, not a marketing page. It shows the pet,
selected custom pet, notification prefs, recent jobs/events, overlay endpoint status,
voice preview controls, and foundational achievements. The overview centers the
active pet, keeps recent wrapped-job signal close by, and shows local transport
health without implying hosted access.

The Change Pet view can switch to a specific built-in species or hatch a fresh
random pet. Both choices replace the canonical active pet in `pet.json`, matching
`hermes-pet hatch` reset semantics: XP, stats, interactions, milestones, variant,
hat, and timestamps start fresh. Changing the active built-in pet also clears the
current custom visual selection so the visible companion returns to the selected
built-in species, while installed custom pet packages stay on disk.

The Custom Pets view mirrors the CLI workflow for local visual packages:

- `Import` installs a package from a typed local path with an installed name.
- `Use` selects an installed custom pet as the current visual package.
- `Use built-in pet` clears the current custom visual selection without deleting
  installed packages.
- `Remove` deletes an installed custom pet package and clears it if it was
  selected.

Achievements are intentionally foundational. Hermes Pets stores the
local ledger in `achievements.json`, unlocks achievements idempotently, and shows
compact locked/unlocked status in the dashboard. New unlocks can also emit quiet
overlay notices such as `Achievement unlocked: Clean Run`; they are informational
and do not add confetti, sound, modals, or celebration artwork.

The dashboard also supports changing notification profile, quiet mode, tray/idle
toggles, bubble throttle, opt-in voice preview, one harmless voice adapter test,
and dashboard test events when the overlay endpoint is available.

The dashboard deliberately does not include a hosted dashboard, hosted gallery,
drag/drop import, full voice mode, rich celebration system, PyPI publishing, or
installer publishing.

## Custom Animated Pets

Hermes Pets can use custom animated sprite packages without adding generated assets to the repo. Custom pets install into the active state directory:

```text
${HERMES_PET_HOME:-~/.hermes_pet}/custom-pets/<pet-name>/
```

Manage them with:

```bash
hermes-pet custom-pet list
hermes-pet custom-pet validate <path>
hermes-pet custom-pet preview <path> --output /tmp/pet-preview.html
hermes-pet custom-pet preview --installed <name> --output /tmp/pet-preview.html
hermes-pet custom-pet import <path> --name <name>
hermes-pet custom-pet use <name>
hermes-pet custom-pet current
hermes-pet custom-pet remove <name>
```

The same import/select/remove workflow is available in the local dashboard, with
one extra non-destructive control: `Use built-in pet` clears the current custom
visual selection without deleting installed packages. Use the CLI for validation
and preview HTML when preparing a package, then use the dashboard when you want
a compact operator surface for selecting, clearing, or removing installed visual
packages.

`<path>` can be a finalized sprite run or a package with `custom-pet.json` and `sprites/<state>/*.png`. `idle` is required; optional states fall back to idle when missing. See `CUSTOM_PETS.md` for the package format.

For a safe preview workflow, validate or package the pet, inspect the generated contact sheet when present, then run `hermes-pet custom-pet preview <path> --output /tmp/pet-preview.html`. To prove the overlay endpoint and renderer can load the package, import/select it inside a temporary `HERMES_PET_HOME` and run `scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh` or launch with `hermes-pet launch --replace`.

## Launch

Start the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet launch
```

`launch` first installs or updates the managed Hermes lifecycle plugin at
`~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-pet` from this checkout. That is the default event path
for both WSL/Windows and macOS. Restart Hermes TUI after `launch` reports that
the plugin was installed or updated so the TUI reloads the hook files.

On WSL/Windows, `launch` uses `src/hermes_pet/overlay/scripts/launch-windows-overlay.ps1`.
That launcher keeps the Electron install in
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesAgent\pet-overlay-electron`, reuses an existing overlay
when one is already running, and starts the overlay WebSocket endpoint on port
`17473`.

The launch boundary is:

```text
WSL shell
  -> hermes-pet launch
  -> sync ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-pet
  -> Windows PowerShell launcher
  -> Electron dependency cache in %LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesAgent\pet-overlay-electron
  -> floating Windows overlay with built-in WS server on 0.0.0.0:17473
  -> Hermes TUI plugin and CLI events sent to the overlay endpoint
```

On macOS, `launch --replace` starts the local Python WebSocket endpoint and the
native Electron overlay with the same plugin event contract:

```text
macOS shell
  -> hermes-pet launch --replace
  -> sync ~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-pet
  -> local Python endpoint on 127.0.0.1:17473
  -> native Electron overlay
  -> Hermes TUI plugin and CLI events sent to the local endpoint
```

`hermes-pet hermes-plugin install --replace` remains available for manual repair
or when you want to update the plugin without launching the overlay. Use
`hermes-pet hermes-plugin export --output <dir> --replace` only for a standalone
handoff or vendoring flow.

Keep `pwsh.exe` or `powershell.exe` discoverable from WSL, and keep
`/mnt/c/Windows/system32` available on `PATH` so process checks work. If the CLI
reports that PowerShell or Windows process checks are missing, run
`hermes-pet doctor` from the same WSL shell you use for `hermes-pet launch`.

Replace a stale or duplicate overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Check overlay endpoint and process status:

```bash
hermes-pet overlay-status
```

Close the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet close
```

Optionally also stop stale legacy bridge processes:

```bash
hermes-pet close --bridge
```

Useful environment variables:

- `HERMES_PET_HOME`: state directory, default `~/.hermes_pet`.
- `HERMES_PET_PORT`: overlay WebSocket port, default `17473`.
- `HERMES_PET_HOST`: event destination host for CLI sends.
- `HERMES_PET_WS_URL`: explicit overlay WebSocket URL.
- `HERMES_PET_POSITION_FILE`: overlay window position file.
- `HERMES_PET_SPECIES`: overlay species, default `cat`.
- `HERMES_PET_PROJECT_ID`, `HERMES_PET_PROJECT_PATH`: default structured project context for emitted events.
- `HERMES_PET_SESSION_ID`, `HERMES_PET_SESSION_LABEL`: default structured session context for emitted events.
- `HERMES_PET_CLICK_THROUGH=1`: make the overlay ignore mouse input.
- `HERMES_PET_FOCUSABLE=1`: allow the overlay to accept focus.
- `HERMES_PET_DEBUG_EVENTS=1`, `HERMES_PET_DEBUG_ANIMATION=1`, `HERMES_PET_DEBUG_DRAG=1`, `HERMES_PET_DEBUG_SPRITE=1`: diagnostics.
- `HERMES_PET_TTS_COMMAND`: optional voice-preview adapter override. Event text is sent on stdin.

## Voice Preview

Voice mode is off by default and remains an opt-in preview:

```bash
hermes-pet voice status
hermes-pet voice on
hermes-pet voice off
hermes-pet voice set-command -- <command>
hermes-pet voice test "Hermes Pets voice preview test."
```

The adapter command receives text on stdin and event metadata in environment
variables such as `HERMES_PET_TTS_EVENT_TYPE`, `HERMES_PET_TTS_SEVERITY`, and
`HERMES_PET_TTS_URGENCY`. Preview voice events are allowlisted to
`message_received`, `job_failed`, `approval_needed`, and explicit tests.
Missing, failing, disabled, or timed-out voice commands do not break pet events.

## Emit Events

Emit an ambient event to the live overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet emit bubble "Starting work"
hermes-pet emit status "Tests are running"
hermes-pet emit approval_needed "Review requested"
```

Supported event types:

```text
approval_needed
bubble
daily_brief
job_failed
job_finished
job_history
job_started
message_received
status
```

Events are also appended to local event history under `~/.hermes_pet`.

### Hermes-aware context

Hermes-aware events are schema-first and local-only. They store stable context
fields and feed the local `session_thread`, but they do not add a live
Hermes Agent, Nexus, Telegram, GitHub, calendar, or other adapter.

All emitted events continue to use `schema: hermes.pet.event.v1`. The stable
context fields are optional:

- `project_id`, `project_path`
- `session_id`, `session_label`
- `source`, `source_id`
- `urgency`: `normal`, `important`, or `urgent`
- `action_label`, `action_command`, `action_url`
- `privacy_summary`

Use CLI flags for per-event context:

```bash
hermes-pet emit approval_needed "Review deploy plan" \
  --project-id hermes-pet \
  --session-label "1.0 local work"

hermes-pet wrap --name "API tests" \
  --project-id hermes-pet \
  --session-id hermes-pet-1-local \
  -- pytest
```

Or set environment defaults:

```bash
export HERMES_PET_PROJECT_ID=hermes-pet
export HERMES_PET_PROJECT_PATH=/home/tony/projects/hermes-pet
export HERMES_PET_SESSION_ID=hermes-pet-1-local
export HERMES_PET_SESSION_LABEL="1.0 local work"
```

Precedence is CLI flags, then environment variables, then safe inferred
defaults. `run` and `wrap` infer the current git repository as project context
when no explicit project is provided.

## Wrap and Run

Wrap named work:

```bash
hermes-pet wrap --name "API tests" -- pytest
```

Run a command with an inferred or optional name:

```bash
hermes-pet run -- npm test
hermes-pet run --name "Docs build" -- npm run build
```

Wrapped commands emit:

- `job_started` before launch.
- `status` during long-running work, every 60 seconds by default.
- `job_finished` for exit code `0`.
- `job_failed` for non-zero exits, launch failures, or interruption.

Disable long-running status events:

```bash
hermes-pet wrap --name "Long job" --status-interval 0 -- ./slow-job
```

Hermes Pets records recent jobs in `~/.hermes_pet/jobs.json`, including start/end time, duration, exit code, status, redacted command, and short output/error summaries when output is captured.

## Jobs and Retry

Show recent jobs:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs
hermes-pet jobs --limit 50
hermes-pet jobs --status succeeded
hermes-pet jobs --query tests
```

Inspect the latest job:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs --last
```

Show failures only:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs --failed
hermes-pet jobs --failed --last
```

Retry the latest safe failed job:

```bash
hermes-pet retry
```

Commands with sensitive-looking arguments such as tokens, passwords, secrets, authorization headers, or API keys are redacted and marked non-retryable.

## Messages

Send a message notification:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" "Can you review this?"
```

Mark a message urgent:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" --urgent "Production is blocked"
```

Store an open/respond hint without executing it:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" --open-command "xdg-open https://example.test" "Thread link"
```

Action hints are stored and displayed only. Hermes Pets never executes
`action_command` or opens `action_url` from an event. Use privacy-safe labels and
summaries, and avoid storing raw message bodies, tokens, or private URLs.

## Quiet, Mute, and Prefs

Named notification profiles:

```bash
hermes-pet profile --list
hermes-pet profile focus
hermes-pet profile pairing
hermes-pet profile demo
hermes-pet profile silent
```

Important-only quiet mode:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet
```

Silent mode for non-critical bubbles:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet --silent
```

Return to normal:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet --off
```

Mute non-urgent bubbles temporarily:

```bash
hermes-pet mute 30m
hermes-pet mute 2h
```

Inspect or update preferences:

```bash
hermes-pet prefs
hermes-pet prefs profile focus
hermes-pet prefs set quiet_mode important
hermes-pet prefs set bubble_throttle_seconds 5
hermes-pet prefs set show_idle_bubbles false
```

Preferences live in `~/.hermes_pet/notification-prefs.json`.

## State Export and Cleanup

Export a compact redacted snapshot of local prefs, pet state, jobs, and events for diagnostics:

```bash
hermes-pet state export --since 24h
hermes-pet state export --output hermes-state.json
```

State export is intentionally not a backup. It redacts command and event details and only includes bounded history for support/debugging. To make a real restorable backup, copy the active state directory while Hermes Pets is closed or quiet:

```bash
hermes-pet close --bridge
state_home="${HERMES_PET_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes_pet}"
backup_dir="$HOME/hermes-pet-backups/hermes-pet-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$backup_dir")"
cp -a "$state_home" "$backup_dir"
```

Restore by closing Hermes Pets, moving the current state aside, copying the backup back into place, and launching again:

```bash
hermes-pet close --bridge
state_home="${HERMES_PET_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes_pet}"
mv "$state_home" "${state_home}.before-restore.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
cp -a "$backup_dir" "$state_home"
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Compact bounded local history:

```bash
hermes-pet state cleanup --dry-run --keep-jobs 50 --keep-events 100
hermes-pet state cleanup --keep-jobs 50 --keep-events 100
```

Hermes-aware metadata in event history and state export is allowlisted and redacted.
Unknown event metadata is dropped, and structured fields such as action hints,
paths, source labels, session labels, and privacy summaries are cleaned before
they appear in exports.

## Brief

Summarize recent local jobs and events:

```bash
hermes-pet brief
hermes-pet brief --since 2h
hermes-pet brief --since 7d
```

Emit the brief to the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet brief --emit
```

Print a compact chat-friendly version:

```bash
hermes-pet brief --telegram-text
```

Briefs prioritize urgent events, approval requests, failed jobs, recent
messages, and stored action hints. When multiple recent events include
project/session context, the brief groups them by project and session. The
Telegram-friendly form keeps the same priorities but stays compact.

## Doctor

Run operator diagnostics:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor
```

Doctor checks Python, CLI availability, the `websockets` package, overlay endpoint reachability, overlay files, Windows overlay status when available, state directory writeability, preferences, and recent job history.

Warnings do not always mean the tool is unusable. A bridge/endpoint warning usually means the Windows overlay WebSocket endpoint is not running or not reachable yet; use `hermes-pet launch` or `hermes-pet launch --replace`.

Use strict mode in CI-style checks when warnings should fail the command:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor --strict
```

## Smoke Checks

Run the local smoke against an isolated state directory:

```bash
scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --temp-state
```

Also run the live manual overlay checklist in
`OPERATOR_GUIDE.md`. It covers `launch --replace`, job/message/brief event
reactions, tray grouping and attention borders, quiet/profile behavior,
reconnect handling, and custom pet fallback in the real Electron overlay.

Treat the checks as complementary:

- `scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --temp-state` verifies CLI behavior, state writes, wrapping, brief generation, and endpoint warnings without polluting daily state.
- `node scripts/smoke-renderer.js` verifies renderer event-reaction logic, custom pet loading, and fallback behavior without starting Electron.
- `scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh` is the scripted verifier for real WSL-to-Windows launch, visible animation, tray grouping, attention state, reconnect behavior, and custom pet fallback.

Run renderer behavior smoke coverage without launching Electron:

```bash
node scripts/smoke-renderer.js
```

Renderer smoke coverage is valuable but headless. It does not prove Electron launched, the Windows overlay is visible, the sprite is correctly framed on screen, or the live overlay endpoint can receive events.

For current Hermes-aware companion readiness, run:

```bash
pytest
node scripts/smoke-renderer.js
scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --temp-state
scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh
```

Run `scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh` when the local environment can launch the
real WSL/Windows overlay.

For the `1.0.0` release readiness stack, run:

```bash
python3 -m compileall -q src/hermes_pet
uv run pytest
node --check src/hermes_pet/overlay/src/renderer.js
node --check src/hermes_pet/overlay/src/main.js
node --check src/hermes_pet/overlay/src/main.windows.js
node --check src/hermes_pet/overlay/src/preload.js
node --check src/hermes_pet/dashboard/app.js
node scripts/smoke-renderer.js
bash -n shell-helpers/hermes-pet.bash scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh scripts/smoke-github-install.sh scripts/verify-packaged-overlay.sh scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh
python3 scripts/validate-sprite-manifest.py
scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --temp-state
scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --fresh-install
scripts/verify-packaged-overlay.sh
python3 scripts/verify-package-artifacts.py
scripts/verify-live-overlay.sh
HERMES_PET_INSTALL_TARGET=/home/tony/projects/hermes-pet scripts/smoke-github-install.sh
hermes-pet doctor
```

Then record dashboard QA evidence by launching `hermes-pet dashboard --no-open`
against a temporary `HERMES_PET_HOME`, importing/selecting
`docs/fixtures/custom-pets/minimal-spark`, changing prefs, running a harmless
voice test adapter, and capturing desktop plus narrow/mobile screenshots.

## Shell Helpers

Optional Bash helpers live in `shell-helpers/hermes-pet.bash`:

```bash
source /home/tony/projects/hermes-pet/shell-helpers/hermes-pet.bash
```

They provide:

- `hp`: `hermes-pet`
- `hpl`: `hermes-pet launch`
- `hps`: `hermes-pet overlay-status`
- `hpjobs`: `hermes-pet jobs`
- `hpfail`: `hermes-pet jobs --failed --last`
- `hpq`: quiet mode helper
- `hpmute`: mute helper, default `30m`
- `hpwrap "Job name" -- command arg...`
- `hpbrief`: brief helper

## Smoke Script

Run the local smoke script:

```bash
scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh
```

It checks prefs, runs doctor, emits a bubble, wraps one successful command, wraps one expected failure, prints the latest job, and generates a brief. If the overlay is not running, the emit step may warn while the wrapper and history checks still run.

## Windows and WSL Notes

Hermes Pets is tuned for WSL driving a Windows Electron overlay. The Hermes TUI
event path is still the managed `hermes-pet` plugin, matching macOS.

- Run CLI commands from WSL.
- The Electron overlay resources live in `src/hermes_pet/overlay/`.
- `hermes-pet launch` installs or updates `~/.hermes/plugins/hermes-pet`.
- `hermes-pet launch` launches Electron through PowerShell on Windows; the overlay owns the live WebSocket endpoint.
- `hermes-pet launch --replace` is the recovery path for duplicate or stale overlays.
- The Windows overlay dependencies are cached under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesAgent\pet-overlay-electron`.
- Overlay position is stored in `~/.hermes_pet/overlay-position.json` unless overridden.
- If `emit`, `message`, or `brief --emit` cannot reach the endpoint, run `hermes-pet doctor` and then `hermes-pet launch`.

## Recovery

For most daily issues:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet overlay-status
hermes-pet launch --replace
hermes-pet emit bubble "Sprite check"
```

For history and preference issues:

```bash
hermes-pet prefs
hermes-pet jobs --last
hermes-pet brief --since 24h
```

For update issues, start with a non-mutating check:

```bash
hermes-pet update --check
hermes-pet update --dry-run --no-install
```

If fetch fails, check your network and remote access, then rerun
`hermes-pet update --check`. If fast-forward fails, inspect `git status` and
`git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`; Hermes Pets will not merge,
rebase, hard reset, or auto-stash for you. If dependency refresh fails, rerun
the printed Python or overlay install command after installing the missing
package manager or fixing the reported tool error. If validation fails, rerun
`hermes-pet --version` and then decide whether to reinstall from the same source
or recover the git checkout manually.

Backups for update recovery should copy the real `~/.hermes_pet` directory.
`hermes-pet state export` is useful diagnostic output, not a restorable backup.
