# Hermes Pets Operator Guide

This is the short version for daily use.

## Startup

Start the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet launch
```

If you see duplicate overlays or the sprite looks stale, replace the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Check what is running:

```bash
hermes-pet overlay-status
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet doctor --strict
```

On WSL/Windows, run these commands from WSL. `launch` calls the Windows PowerShell
launcher at `overlay/scripts/launch-windows-overlay.ps1`. That launcher keeps
Electron dependencies in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\HermesAgent\pet-overlay-electron`. The
Electron overlay includes a built-in WebSocket server at `0.0.0.0:17473`.
TUI and CLI events are sent directly to `ws://172.27.128.1:17473` (the WSL2
Windows gateway IP) or the endpoint configured by `HERMES_PET_WS_URL`. No
separate Python bridge process is required for normal WSL/Windows use, although
the legacy `bridge` name still appears in some CLI and diagnostic labels.

The full overlay path is supported on WSL2/Windows only. Native Linux, macOS,
and native Windows remain investigation targets until their launcher, process
control, and live verification paths are proven. See
`docs/platform-support.md` before describing a platform as supported.

For reliable launch checks, keep `/mnt/c/Windows/System32/WindowsPowerShell/v1.0`
and `/mnt/c/Windows/system32` on the WSL `PATH`. If `doctor`, `overlay-status`,
`launch`, or `close` cannot find the Windows launcher or process tools, fix the
WSL shell `PATH` first, then rerun `hermes-pet doctor`.

Close only the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet close
```

Add `--bridge` only when you also want to clean up any stale legacy bridge processes remaining from older sessions.

## Local Dashboard Preview

Start the local dashboard from WSL:

```bash
hermes-pet dashboard
hermes-pet dashboard --no-open
```

It binds to localhost and prints a private token URL. Keep that URL local and do
not share it in logs. The dashboard and APIs reject requests without the token.

Use it for daily operator work: inspect pet state, recent jobs/events, overlay
endpoint status, change the active built-in pet, manage custom visual packages,
notification preferences, opt-in voice preview, and foundational achievements.
Custom pet import is intentionally typed-path only; validate or
preview packages with the CLI before importing them from the dashboard.

The Change Pet view replaces the canonical active pet in `pet.json`. Choosing a
built-in species or using random hatch creates a fresh companion, matching
`hermes-pet hatch`: XP, stats, interactions, and milestones reset. Installed
custom pet packages are kept, but the current custom visual selection is cleared
so the overlay returns to the active built-in species.

The Custom Pets view manages visual packages only. `Use custom` selects an
installed package for the overlay, `Use built-in pet` or `Clear` only removes the
current visual override, and `Remove` deletes the installed package directory.

For dashboard QA, use a temporary state root:

```bash
qa_home="$(mktemp -d)"
HERMES_PET_HOME="$qa_home" hermes-pet hatch
HERMES_PET_HOME="$qa_home" hermes-pet custom-pet import docs/fixtures/custom-pets/minimal-spark --name minimal-spark
HERMES_PET_HOME="$qa_home" hermes-pet custom-pet use minimal-spark
HERMES_PET_HOME="$qa_home" hermes-pet dashboard --no-open
```

Then verify desktop and narrow/mobile views for overview, custom pets,
change pet, preferences, voice, achievements, empty states, populated states,
cancel confirmation, and API error states. There should be no overlapping
controls, clipped text, blank placeholder panels, or marketing-page layout.

## Manual Live Overlay Verification

Use this checklist before calling overlay behavior ready. Run it from
WSL/Windows with the real Electron overlay visible, not just renderer smoke
coverage.

Renderer and package smokes are necessary but narrower. `node scripts/smoke-renderer.js`
checks renderer logic without Electron, custom pet package validation checks the package
contract, and `scripts/smoke-hermes-pet.sh --temp-state` checks CLI/state behavior.
This live checklist is the verifier for the full WSL-to-Windows overlay path:
launch, endpoint reachability, visibility, animation framing, panel behavior,
attention borders, reconnect, and real custom pet loading.

Start from a known-good live overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet launch --replace
hermes-pet overlay-status
```

- Confirm `launch --replace` closes stale or duplicate overlays, leaves one
  visible overlay serving the configured WebSocket endpoint, and does not leave an
  orphaned Electron window after a second replace.
- Emit or trigger `job_started` and confirm the pet enters the working/running
  state, shows a concise job bubble or status card, and records the job in the
  tray/history view.
- Trigger `job_finished` with a successful wrapped command and confirm the pet
  returns from working state, shows success feedback, and groups the completed
  job with the prior start event instead of creating a confusing duplicate item.
- Trigger `job_failed` with an expected failing wrapped command and confirm the
  pet shows failure feedback, the tray item is easy to distinguish from success,
  and the overlay attention border appears when the failure needs review.
- Emit `approval_needed` and confirm the review/attention state is visible, the
  tray groups the approval request clearly, and the attention border remains
  noticeable without blocking the desktop.
- Send `message_received` with `--urgent` and confirm it cuts through quiet or
  muted non-critical handling, produces visible attention feedback, and remains
  grouped with message activity in the tray.
- Emit `daily_brief` with `hermes-pet brief --emit` and confirm the summary is
  readable in the overlay, does not look urgent unless it contains urgent
  content, and appears as brief activity in the tray.
- Exercise tray grouping by creating a start, finish, failure, approval, urgent
  message, and daily brief in one session; confirm related job events collapse
  together while distinct attention types remain scannable.
- Switch profiles with `hermes-pet profile focus`, `pairing`, `demo`, and
  `silent`; confirm each profile changes bubble/attention behavior as expected
  and `hermes-pet profile normal` restores ordinary behavior.
- Toggle quiet modes with `hermes-pet quiet`, `hermes-pet quiet --silent`, and
  `hermes-pet quiet --off`; confirm non-critical bubbles are reduced or hidden
  while urgent messages, failures, and approvals still surface appropriately.
- Test reconnect by stopping or closing the overlay endpoint, restarting
  with `hermes-pet launch` or `hermes-pet launch --replace`, and confirming new
  events appear without needing to clear local state.
- Select a valid custom pet, relaunch with `hermes-pet launch --replace`, and
  confirm it animates for idle, work, success, failure, attention, and message
  states. Then select or simulate an invalid/missing custom pet and confirm the
  overlay falls back to the built-in pet instead of rendering blank.

Useful manual event commands:

```bash
hermes-pet emit approval_needed "Manual approval check"
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" --urgent "Production is blocked"
hermes-pet brief --emit
hermes-pet wrap --name "Manual success" -- true
hermes-pet wrap --name "Manual failure" -- false
```

## Daily Workflow

Use the pet as a lightweight activity layer:

```bash
hermes-pet status
hermes-pet emit bubble "Starting work"
hermes-pet brief
```

Keep the overlay running in the background. Use `wrap` or `run` for work you want in job history.

## Hermes-Aware Context

Hermes-aware context is schema-first. Hermes Pets can store project/session
context and action hints on local events, and the local runtime groups related
events into `session_thread`. It does not add a live Hermes Agent, Nexus,
Telegram, GitHub, calendar, or other adapter.

Set defaults once per shell when a work session should be grouped:

```bash
export HERMES_PET_PROJECT_ID=hermes-pet
export HERMES_PET_PROJECT_PATH=/home/tony/projects/hermes-pet
export HERMES_PET_SESSION_ID=hermes-pet-1-local
export HERMES_PET_SESSION_LABEL="1.0 local work"
```

Override defaults per command with shared flags:

```bash
hermes-pet emit approval_needed "Review deploy plan" \
  --project-id hermes-pet \
  --session-label "1.0 local work"

hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" \
  --project-id hermes-pet \
  --session-label "1.0 local work" \
  --open-command "gh issue view 17" \
  "Can you review this?"

hermes-pet wrap --name "Tests" --project-id hermes-pet -- pytest
```

Precedence is CLI flags, environment variables, then safe inferred defaults.
`run` and `wrap` infer the current git repository as project context when no
explicit project is provided.

Action hints are hints only. Hermes Pets stores and displays action labels,
commands, and URLs in briefs and event history, but never executes them or opens
URLs from event data.

The local runtime groups these events into `session_thread`. For a quick
coherence check, run the smoke flow and confirm these log markers appear in the
overlay log:

```text
session-thread-applied
session-bubble
bubble-signal
panel-render
```

## Custom Pets

Install animated custom pets outside the repo:

```bash
hermes-pet custom-pet validate <path>
hermes-pet custom-pet import <path> --name <name>
hermes-pet custom-pet use <name>
hermes-pet custom-pet current
```

Custom pets live under `${HERMES_PET_HOME:-~/.hermes_pet}/custom-pets/<name>/`. Use `hermes-pet custom-pet list` to see installed pets and `hermes-pet custom-pet remove <name>` to delete one.

A tiny repo fixture is available for validating the custom pet path without
generating art:

```bash
hermes-pet custom-pet validate docs/fixtures/custom-pets/minimal-spark
hermes-pet custom-pet import docs/fixtures/custom-pets/minimal-spark --name minimal-spark
hermes-pet custom-pet use minimal-spark
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Preview a new package without changing your daily state:

```bash
hermes-pet custom-pet preview <path> --output /tmp/custom-pet-preview.html
```

For live overlay behavior, import it into a temporary `HERMES_PET_HOME`:

```bash
preview_home="$(mktemp -d)"
HERMES_PET_HOME="$preview_home" hermes-pet custom-pet validate <path>
HERMES_PET_HOME="$preview_home" hermes-pet custom-pet import <path> --name preview-pet
HERMES_PET_HOME="$preview_home" hermes-pet custom-pet preview --installed preview-pet --output /tmp/preview-pet.html
HERMES_PET_HOME="$preview_home" hermes-pet custom-pet use preview-pet
HERMES_PET_HOME="$preview_home" hermes-pet launch --replace
```

For generated pets, inspect the contact sheet first when the package includes one.
For hand-built templates, start with the copyable template in
`docs/templates/custom-pets/basic`: `custom-pet.json`, `sprites/idle/`,
and safe PNG frame names.

## Wrapping Work

Wrap named work:

```bash
hermes-pet wrap --name "API tests" -- pytest
```

Run a command with an inferred name:

```bash
hermes-pet run -- npm test
```

Hermes Pets records start, success, failure, duration, exit code, and a redacted command. Sensitive-looking flags are not retryable.

Retry the latest safe failed job:

```bash
hermes-pet retry
```

## Messages

Send a message notification:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" "Can you review this?"
```

Mark it urgent when it should cut through quiet handling:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" --urgent "Production is blocked"
```

Store a response hint without executing it:

```bash
hermes-pet message --source telegram --sender "Ada" --open-command "gh issue view 17" "Thread link"
```

## Quiet and Mute

Use named profiles when you want predictable notification behavior:

```bash
hermes-pet profile --list
hermes-pet profile normal
hermes-pet profile focus
hermes-pet profile pairing
hermes-pet profile demo
hermes-pet profile silent
```

Use quiet mode for fewer bubbles:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet
```

Silence non-critical bubbles:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet --silent
```

Return to normal:

```bash
hermes-pet quiet --off
```

Mute temporarily:

```bash
hermes-pet mute 30m
hermes-pet mute 2h
```

Inspect preferences:

```bash
hermes-pet prefs
hermes-pet prefs profile focus
```

## Checking Jobs

Show recent jobs:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs
```

Show the latest job in detail:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs --last
```

Show failures only:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs --failed
hermes-pet jobs --failed --last
```

Scan a subset by status or text:

```bash
hermes-pet jobs --status succeeded
hermes-pet jobs --query tests
```

## Brief and Recap

Summarize recent activity:

```bash
hermes-pet brief
hermes-pet brief --since 2h
hermes-pet brief --since 7d
```

Emit the brief to the overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet brief --emit
```

Print a compact text version for chat:

```bash
hermes-pet brief --telegram-text
```

Briefs prioritize urgent events, approval requests, failed jobs, recent
messages, and stored action hints. When recent events include useful
project/session metadata, regular briefs add a project/session grouping section.
The compact Telegram text keeps counts, the top message when present, the most
useful group, and the suggested next action.

## Troubleshooting

Duplicate overlay:

```bash
hermes-pet overlay-status
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Invisible sprite:

```bash
hermes-pet launch --replace
hermes-pet emit bubble "Sprite check"
hermes-pet doctor
```

If it is still invisible, check whether the overlay window is off-screen. The position file is in `~/.hermes_pet/overlay-position.json` unless `HERMES_PET_HOME` is set.

If a custom pet does not appear, run:

```bash
hermes-pet custom-pet current
hermes-pet custom-pet validate ~/.hermes_pet/custom-pets/<name>
hermes-pet launch --replace
```

Invalid custom pets are ignored so built-in species continue to work.

Bridge unavailable:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet launch
hermes-pet overlay-status
```

If `emit`, `message`, or `brief --emit` says the bridge or endpoint is unavailable, the
Electron WebSocket server is not reachable at `ws://172.27.128.1:17473` or the
port set by `HERMES_PET_PORT`. Verify the Electron overlay process is running
with `overlay-status`, and confirm WSL can reach the Windows host with:
`python3 -c "import socket; s=socket.socket(); s.settimeout(2); s.connect(('172.27.128.1', 17473)); print('reachable')"`

CI-style diagnostics:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor --strict
```

Default `doctor` prints warnings but exits successfully so daily operators can
read the report without breaking a shell flow. `--strict` returns non-zero when
any check warns.

WSL-to-Windows launch failure:

```bash
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet overlay-status
command -v powershell.exe
```

`hermes-pet launch` needs the Windows PowerShell and Windows process tools to
agree. A sanitized shell is fine, but it still needs the Windows PowerShell and
system directories on `PATH`. The Electron overlay's built-in WebSocket server
must also be reachable from WSL — see the firewall rules in `hermes-pets-windows-overlay` skill.

Prefs or jobs look wrong:

```bash
hermes-pet prefs
hermes-pet jobs --last
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet state export --since 24h
hermes-pet state cleanup --dry-run --keep-jobs 50 --keep-events 100
```

`state export` is for redacted diagnostics. It is useful to share a compact
support snapshot, but it drops or redacts information and is not restorable as
local state.

State is stored under `~/.hermes_pet` by default. Set `HERMES_PET_HOME` only when
you intentionally want a separate pet state. To back up the active state, copy
the directory itself:

```bash
hermes-pet close --bridge
state_home="${HERMES_PET_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes_pet}"
backup_dir="$HOME/hermes-pet-backups/hermes-pet-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
mkdir -p "$(dirname "$backup_dir")"
cp -a "$state_home" "$backup_dir"
```

To restore, close Hermes Pets, preserve the current directory, copy the backup
back, and verify before using it:

```bash
hermes-pet close --bridge
state_home="${HERMES_PET_HOME:-$HOME/.hermes_pet}"
mv "$state_home" "${state_home}.before-restore.$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
cp -a "$backup_dir" "$state_home"
hermes-pet doctor
hermes-pet launch --replace
```
